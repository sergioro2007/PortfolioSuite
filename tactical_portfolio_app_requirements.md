# Portfolio Management Suite v2.0 - Technical Requirements

This comprehensive investment management platform combines tactical momentum tracking with long-term quality stock analysis. The tactical tracker component has achieved **100% parity** with the original standalone application while being integrated into a modular, multi-feature architecture.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Goals

### ⚡ Tactical Momentum Component:
- Achieve **0.5-3% weekly returns** per position (user-configurable).
- Maintain a **portfolio of up to 25 U.S.-listed stocks/ETFs** with a market cap above $5B.
- **Automatically adjust cash allocation** based on market regime (0-30% defensive cash).
- Rotate out of underperforming stocks weekly or daily if needed.
- React defensively when market conditions deteriorate with intelligent cash preservation.

### 🛡️ Long-Term Quality Component:
- Identify **10-15 high-quality dividend stocks** for portfolio foundation.
- Focus on **defensive sectors** (Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Utilities) with consistent performance.
- Maintain **low volatility** (beta ≤ 1.2) and **strong fundamentals** (ROE >10%).
- Provide **quarterly rebalancing** recommendations with minimal turnover.
- Complement tactical strategies with stable, income-generating positions.

---

## ✅ Selection Criteria

1. **Liquidity & Market Cap**
   - Stocks/ETFs must have market cap > $5B
   - High average daily volume

2. **Momentum & Technicals**
   - User-configurable RS score threshold (default: 30+ for standard screening)
   - Favorable technical setups: breakouts, cup-with-handle, strong trend
   - Comprehensive technical analysis including RSI, MACD, moving averages

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - User-configurable minimum weekly return target (default: 1.5%)
   - Must meet tactical criteria: **at least 3 of last 4 weeks > 2%** gain
   - **Average weekly return > 1.5%** (strictly enforced before scoring)
   - Automatic exit if position underperforms or violates risk management rules

4. **Parameter Enforcement**
   - ✅ User-defined parameters are strictly enforced
   - ✅ Tactical momentum rules applied before any scoring
   - ✅ Transparent filtering with detailed qualification reasons

---

## 🤖 Automated Ticker Discovery & Screening

- The application **automatically discovers qualifying tickers** from S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, and other major indices
- **Multi-stage screening process**:
  1. Basic filters: Market cap > $5B, sufficient volume
  2. User-defined criteria: RS score and weekly return thresholds
  3. Technical analysis: RSI, MACD, moving average trends
  4. Risk management: Volatility and drawdown checks
- **Real-time data integration** using yfinance API
- **Intelligent result limiting**: Up to 25 tickers in aggressive mode, 15 in defensive mode
- **Transparent qualification**: Each ticker comes with detailed reasoning for inclusion/exclusion

## 🛡️ NEW: Intelligent Defensive Cash Allocation

### Automatic Market Regime Detection
The app continuously monitors **6 real-time market signals** and automatically adjusts portfolio allocation:

**Market Health Signals Monitored:**
1. **VIX > 30** (fear index threshold)
2. **VIX Rising Trend** (increasing market fear)
3. **SPY below 20-day MA** (market weakness)
4. **Market Breadth < 50%** (few stocks advancing)
5. **High Volatility > 2.5%** (excessive daily price swings)
6. **Negative Momentum** (10-day < 30-day moving averages)

### Dynamic Cash Allocation by Market Regime

- **🟢 AGGRESSIVE** (0-1 signals): **0% cash** - Full stock allocation
- **🟠 CAUTIOUS** (2 signals): **5% cash** - Small defensive buffer  
- **🟡 DEFENSIVE** (3 signals): **15% cash** - Moderate risk reduction
- **🔴 HIGHLY_DEFENSIVE** (4+ signals): **30% cash** - Significant capital preservation

### User Control & Transparency
- **"Allow Defensive Cash" checkbox** - Users can disable automatic cash allocation
- **Real-time preview** - Shows exact stock vs. cash allocation percentages
- **Market regime indicator** - Color-coded status with explanations
- **Educational UI** - Clear explanations of why defensive positioning is active

---

## 🎯 Enhanced Portfolio Allocation System

### Two-Tier Position Sizing
- **Strong Buy positions**: 8-20% allocation (user adjustable)
- **Moderate Buy positions**: 3-12% allocation (user adjustable)
- **Automatic scaling**: Ensures total allocation = 100% using integer percentages

### Qualification Criteria
- **Strong Buys**: Momentum score > 15 AND weekly return > 2.0%
- **Moderate Buys**: Momentum score > 10 (excluding strong buys)
- **Watch List**: Promising stocks that don't quite qualify

### Real-Time Allocation Management
- **Integer-only percentages** for practical implementation
- **Automatic adjustment** to exactly 100% total allocation
- **Priority weighting** (strong buys get allocation adjustments first)
- **Live feedback** showing allocation previews and adjustments

---

## 🔁 Daily Reevaluation Logic

Each day, check:

- Ticker's % change from 10AM price
- Flag if:
  - Drop > 3% → Review/Exit
  - Drop > 1.5% → Watch closely
  - Gain > 2% → Strong Momentum
