# NVDA 172.5 CALL Pricing Fix - SUCCESSFUL ✅

## Issue Fixed
The system was showing **$0.32** for NVDA 172.5 CALL when the real market price on Webull was **$1.78** and yfinance was **$1.73**.

## Root Cause
The bug was in the `get_option_prices()` function in `options_tracker.py`. The code was converting decimal strikes to integers:

```python
# BEFORE (Buggy Code)
strike_int = int(strike)  # 172.5 becomes 172 ❌
call_match = calls[calls['strike'] == strike_int]  # Looking for 172 instead of 172.5
```

This caused the system to:
1. ❌ Look for strike 172 instead of 172.5 in yfinance data
2. ❌ Not find the real market data for 172.5 
3. ❌ Fall back to estimated pricing ($0.32 instead of real $1.73)

## Solution Applied
Fixed the strike matching to preserve decimal values:

```python
# AFTER (Fixed Code)
strike_key = f"{strike:g}"  # Preserves 172.5 as "172.5" ✅
call_match = calls[calls['strike'] == strike]  # Exact decimal match
option_prices[f"CALL_{strike_key}"] = price  # Uses "CALL_172.5" key
```

## Changes Made
1. **options_tracker.py** - Fixed `get_option_prices()` to preserve decimal strikes
2. **options_tracker.py** - Updated all price key references to use `:g` formatting
3. **options_tracker.py** - Fixed fallback pricing function to use decimal keys
4. **All strategy functions** - Updated to use new decimal-preserving key format

## Results Verified ✅
